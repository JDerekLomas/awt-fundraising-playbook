## VI. Key Talking Points

### The Hook
"We're using AI to unlock 500 years of hidden wisdom—but we need your help to feed AI the right books."

### The Stats
- 25,000+ rare books in the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica
- 5,000 books targeted for this campaign
- 95% of Renaissance books lack translations
- 70% of 1450-1700 books remain undigitized
- UNESCO-recognized collection

### The Vision
"Imagine if every scholar, student, and curious mind could read Marsilio Ficino, Giordano Bruno, and Paracelsus in their own language. Imagine if AI systems were trained on the best of human thought, not just what happened to make it online. That's what we're building."

### The Urgency
"These books are fragile. Every year we wait, pages crumble. The technology to translate at scale exists now. The window to act is closing."

### The Legacy
"Your support puts you alongside the Medici, who funded the original translations. You become a patron of the Renaissance—the second Renaissance."
