I'm reaching out personally because I think you might care about this.

I've been working on something for the past year: the Ancient Wisdom Trust is digitizing and translating 5,000 rare Renaissance texts—books that shaped Copernicus, Newton, and the entire Western intellectual tradition, but remain locked away in Latin, inaccessible to everyone except a handful of specialists.

Here's the thing: 95% of Renaissance books have never been translated. 70% haven't even been digitized. This wisdom is literally crumbling away.

I'm personally matching every gift up to $10,000. That means if you give $250, we receive $500—enough to translate and publish one complete work, free to the world forever.

Would you consider being part of this?

$250 (= $500 matched) publishes one AI translation. $500 (= $1,000) digitizes an entire rare book. $1,000 (= $2,000) funds an expert-supervised translation with your name in the acknowledgments.

No pressure either way. I just thought you might be someone who cares about preserving the best of human thought.

Here's where to give: [DONATION LINK]

Thank you for reading this far.

Warmly,
Derek

I wanted to share something I've gotten involved with that I think you'd find interesting.

The Ancient Wisdom Trust is working to digitize and translate 5,000 rare Renaissance texts—philosophy, science, and esoteric works that shaped the modern world but have never been accessible in English. 95% of Renaissance books lack translations. They're using AI to change that at scale.

I'm helping because I believe this kind of knowledge preservation matters. And right now, there's a matching gift that doubles every donation up to $10,000.

If this resonates with you, I'd love to connect you with Derek, who's leading the project. Or you can learn more and give directly here: [DONATION LINK]

No obligation at all—just thought of you when I learned about this work.

Quick update on the Ancient Wisdom Trust matching campaign:

We've raised $[AMOUNT] of the $10,000 match—which means $[REMAINING] is still available to be doubled.

Every gift right now is worth twice as much:
• $250 → $500 (publishes 1 AI translation)
• $500 → $1,000 (digitizes 1 rare book)
• $1,000 → $2,000 (expert translation with your name)

If you've been thinking about giving, now is the time when your gift has the most impact.

Think about that. The intellectual foundation of the modern world—philosophy, science, medicine, art—and we can only read 5% of it.

Books by Ficino, Bruno, Agrippa, Paracelsus. Works that shaped Newton, Copernicus, and the entire Enlightenment. Locked away in Latin.

I'm working to change that.

The Ancient Wisdom Trust is digitizing and translating 5,000 rare texts from the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica in Amsterdam—one of the world's most important collections.

We're using AI to translate at a scale that was impossible just a few years ago.

Most AI training data is recent, digital-native content. Reddit threads. Wikipedia. News articles.

But what about 500 years of philosophy, science, and wisdom that never made it to the internet?

That's what we're fixing at the Ancient Wisdom Trust.

We're translating 5,000 Renaissance texts that have never been in English. Hermetic philosophy. Early science. Alchemical works that influenced Jung and modern psychology.

This is about more than preservation. It's about ensuring AI systems understand the full depth of human knowledge.

But here I am.

A year ago, I discovered that 95% of Renaissance books have never been translated. The foundational texts of Western thought—philosophy, science, spirituality—locked away in Latin.

Books that shaped Newton, Copernicus, the entire modern world. Inaccessible.

So I started the Ancient Wisdom Trust. We're digitizing and translating 5,000 texts from one of the world's greatest collections.

Now I'm asking for help.

I'm personally matching every gift up to $10,000. $500 digitizes one rare book. $1,000 funds an expert translation with your name attached.
