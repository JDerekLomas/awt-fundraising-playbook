We're digitizing and translating 5,000 rare Renaissance texts from the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica in Amsterdam - Hermetic, alchemical, and philosophical works that have never been translated.

Given your role at Tarcher and your network of collectors, would love to discuss potential collaboration.</div>
