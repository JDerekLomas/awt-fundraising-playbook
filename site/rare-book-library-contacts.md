## KEY MESSAGING FOR RARE BOOK WORLD

### What Resonates:
- **Preservation urgency** - physical deterioration, access restrictions
- **Democratization** - making rare texts available to scholars worldwide
- **Technical excellence** - high-resolution, accurate metadata, scholarly standards
- **Original sources** - not facsimiles, but digital surrogates of actual manuscripts
- **Research enablement** - searchability, AI translation, new discoveries
- **Legacy** - donor's name associated with preserving human knowledge

### What Doesn't Resonate:
- Devaluing physical books
- Populist anti-elitism
- Sloppy digitization standards
- Commercial exploitation
- Disrespect for bibliographic tradition

### Tailored Pitches:

**For Collectors:**
"Your collection represents a lifetime of connoisseurship. Digitization ensures these texts survive and reach scholars who could never afford them, while preserving the originals. Your name will be forever associated with making this knowledge accessible."

**For Librarians:**
"We meet the highest preservation standards while enabling research impossible with physical access alone. AI translation unlocks Latin and Italian texts for the first time, enabling discoveries in your collections."

**For Dealers:**
"Digitization doesn't devalue physical books - it increases interest. Look at how auction prices rose for illuminated manuscripts after digitization projects. We're creating new generations of collectors by inspiring them with accessible digital content."

**For Conservators:**
"Every handling damages manuscripts. High-resolution digital surrogates mean 90% of research needs are met without touching originals, while still maintaining the primary research value of the physical artifact for that critical 10%."
