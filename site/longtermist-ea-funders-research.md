## MESSAGING BY AUDIENCE

### For Tech/Crypto (Nat, Daniel, Vitalik, Juan, Balaji)
"We're using AI to unlock Renaissance manuscripts that have been inaccessible for 500 years. Like the Vesuvius Challenge, but for texts that still exist - just locked behind Latin and rare book rooms. Every manuscript we digitize and translate becomes permanent public infrastructure for humanity's knowledge."

### For EA/Longtermist (Jaan, Open Phil, Sarah)
"Preserving foundational Western intellectual texts prevents permanent knowledge loss and enables research for centuries. Renaissance philosophy and science laid groundwork for Enlightenment and modernity. Small investment now ($500K) preserves heritage and enables thousands of researchers in perpetuity."

### For Progress Studies (Patrick, Tyler)
"Renaissance manuscripts contain knowledge that could accelerate modern research, but they're locked behind Latin and library walls. Digital access + AI translation = 10,000x improvement in researcher productivity. Measuring: texts digitized, researchers enabled, papers published using our sources."

### For Institutional (Schmidt, Emerson)
"Creating digital humanities infrastructure for global educational equity. Students and scholars worldwide can access primary sources previously available only to elite institutions. Scalable model: starting with Renaissance, expandable to other periods and languages. Partnership with [Universities/Libraries]."
