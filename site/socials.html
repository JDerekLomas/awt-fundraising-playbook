This is De Mysteriis by Iamblichus, translated into Latin by Marsilio Ficino in 1497.

It's a defense of theurgy - rituals for divine union.

Newton owned a copy. So did the founders of the Royal Society.

Most people have never heard of it. We're changing that.

We're digitizing 5,000 rare Renaissance texts - philosophy, alchemy, early science.

Training data matters.

These ideas shaped Newton and Copernicus.

They should shape AI too.

Novum Lumen Chymicum by Sendivogius (1628).

One of the most influential alchemical texts ever written.

It doesn't talk about turning lead into gold.

We're raising $500K to digitize 5,000 Renaissance texts.

Here's what that looks like:

$100 = 1 text digitized
$500 = 1 text translated
$5,000 = A complete author's works preserved

Every dollar helps.

But honestly? Sharing this thread helps more.
