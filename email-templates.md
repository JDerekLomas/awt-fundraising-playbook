## Template 1: Initial Outreach - Major Donor Prospect

**Subject:** An invitation to unlock 500 years of hidden wisdom

---

Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out because of your demonstrated commitment to [cultural preservation / humanities scholarship / the esoteric tradition / AI ethics].

The Ancient Wisdom Trust is undertaking an unprecedented project: digitizing and translating 5,000 rare NeoLatin texts from the Renaissance—books that shaped Copernicus, Newton, and the entire Western intellectual tradition, yet remain inaccessible to scholars and the public.

Here's what few people realize: 95% of Renaissance books have never been translated. 70% haven't even been digitized. They're locked away, deteriorating, their wisdom lost.

We're changing that. Operating from the Embassy of the Free Mind in Amsterdam—home to the UNESCO-recognized Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica—we're using contemporary AI to translate Latin texts at a scale previously impossible.

I'd welcome the opportunity to share more about this work with you. Would you have 20 minutes for a call in the coming weeks?

Warm regards,

[Your Name]

Ancient Wisdom Trust

P.S. I'd be happy to send you a translated excerpt from one of our texts—perhaps a never-before-translated passage from Marsilio Ficino or Cornelius Agrippa. Just say the word.

## Template 2: Initial Outreach - Academic/Scholarly

**Subject:** Access Renaissance texts you've only read about in footnotes

---

Dear Professor [Name],

Your work on [specific research area] caught my attention, and I wanted to introduce you to a project that may be relevant to your research.

The Ancient Wisdom Trust is digitizing and translating 5,000 NeoLatin texts from the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica in Amsterdam—the world's premier collection of Hermetic, alchemical, and esoteric works. Many of these texts have never been translated; some have never been digitized at all.

Our goal is to make these works freely accessible to scholars like yourself.

We're currently raising $500,000 to complete this initiative, and we're building a community of academic advisors and supporters who recognize the value of this work.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how this project might support your research—and how we might support each other?

Best regards,

## Template 3: Initial Outreach - Tech/AI Community

**Subject:** Training AI on Renaissance wisdom, not just Reddit

---

Hi [Name],

Quick question: What if we could train AI on the best of human thought, not just what happened to make it online?

I'm with the Ancient Wisdom Trust, and we're doing something that might interest you: using AI to translate 5,000 rare Renaissance Latin texts—books by Ficino, Bruno, Agrippa, Paracelsus, and other thinkers who shaped the Western intellectual tradition.

Here's the thing: 95% of Renaissance books lack translations. The AI systems being built today are learning from a radically incomplete picture of human knowledge.

We're working to fix that. And we think the tech community should be part of this effort—not just as funders, but as partners who understand why training data matters.

Would love to connect if this resonates.

## Template 4: Initial Outreach - Esoteric/Spiritual Community

**Subject:** The source texts of the Western Mystery Tradition need your help

---

Dear [Name],

I'm writing to you as a fellow student of the Western esoteric tradition.

You may know of the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica in Amsterdam—home to 25,000+ rare texts on alchemy, hermeticism, Kabbalah, Rosicrucianism, and the mystical arts. It's a UNESCO-recognized treasure, the greatest collection of its kind in the world.

What you may not know: the vast majority of these texts have never been translated. They exist only in Latin, accessible to a handful of specialists. The wisdom of the ages remains locked away.

The Ancient Wisdom Trust is changing that. We're digitizing and translating 5,000 of these texts, making them available to seekers, scholars, and the curious public.

This is the work of our generation: preserving and transmitting the tradition for those who will come after us.

I'd be honored to tell you more about how you can be part of this effort.

In the Light,

[Your Name]
Ancient Wisdom Trust

## Template 5: Foundation/Grant LOI Introduction

**Subject:** Letter of Inquiry - Renaissance Text Digitization Project

---

Dear [Program Officer Name],

I am writing on behalf of the Ancient Wisdom Trust to inquire about [Foundation Name]'s interest in supporting a significant cultural preservation and digital humanities initiative.

**Project Summary:**
The Ancient Wisdom Trust seeks to digitize and translate 5,000 rare NeoLatin texts from the Renaissance (1450-1700), drawn from the UNESCO-recognized Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica in Amsterdam. These texts—spanning hermeticism, alchemy, early science, and humanist philosophy—shaped the intellectual foundations of the modern world yet remain largely inaccessible.

**The Need:**
- 95% of Renaissance books lack translations
- 70% of books from 1450-1700 remain undigitized
- These texts are deteriorating and at risk of permanent loss
- Scholars lack access to primary sources essential for research

**Our Solution:**
Using state-of-the-art digitization and AI-assisted translation, we can preserve these texts and make them freely accessible to scholars and the public at unprecedented scale and speed.

**Request:**
We are seeking a grant of $[amount] over [timeframe] to support [specific project component].

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this initiative further and provide a full proposal if appropriate.

Respectfully,

## Template 10: Year-End Appeal

**Subject:** Last chance to preserve Renaissance wisdom this year

---

Dear [Name],

As 2025 draws to a close, I want to share something remarkable.

This year, the Ancient Wisdom Trust has:
- Digitized [X] texts
- Translated [X] pages

**A gift before December 31 will:**
- Be tax-deductible for 2025
- Be matched by [matching donor, if applicable]

These books won't preserve themselves. Every day we wait, pages crumble. Knowledge is lost. The window to act is now.

**[DONATE NOW]**

Thank you for your partnership in this work.

With gratitude,

[Your Name]
Ancient Wisdom Trust

P.S. If you've already given this year, thank you. Consider forwarding this to a friend who shares our passion for preserving wisdom.
